## Thomas Lite

Thomas Lite is a tool to develop slide templates for Ed.

### Requirements

Thomas requires access to Ed's development environment.

You will also need [Node], [Brunch] and [Bower] installed on your machine. [Scaffolt] is optional, but is useful if creating a lot of templates.

### Running Thomas Lite

You can clone Thomas Lite using brunch. This will run `npm install` and `bower install` for you.

```
brunch new https://github.com/Creative-Licence-Digital/ThomasLite.git your-template
```

Now you are ready to run Thomas...

```
brunch w -s
```

Access Thomas on `localhost:3333`. Thomas watches for any changes you make and reloads the page.

- **CSS components** provide highly abstracted styles to avoid repetitive CSS
  declarations bloating the core CSS framework. Always check whether a class
  aleady exists, and use these styles to help maintain a lightweight codebase.

- **JS libraries** provide core functionality in a modular and re-useable
  format. Like Thomas's CSS, use pre-existing modules when appropriate.
