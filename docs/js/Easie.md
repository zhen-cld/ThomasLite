### Easie

Easing functions by [J. Jeffers](https://github.com/jimjeffers/Easie), ported from [Robert Penner's Easing Equations in CoffeeScript](http://robertpenner.com/easing/).

```
Easie = require("lib/easie")
```

The following methods are available:

```
backIn(time, begin, change, duration, overshoot = 1.70158)
